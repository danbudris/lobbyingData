Discussed with congressional staff the importance of leveling the Area Wage Index playing field for hospitals across the nation. Dozens of hospitals in Texas are negatively impacted by low AWI.

H.R. 3119 - Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act - Would authorize grants to improve the training of health professionals in palliative care. 

S.2425 - Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act - would allow CMS to create a blanket hardship exemption from 2015 electronic health record meaningful use requirements and related payment adjustments to all providers who ask for it. The penalties would have been assessed in 2017.
